:TITLE:Public Database API
:INC:index

:SUB:Introduction
<p>
 This document describes the public API of VNDB and is intended to be read by
  programmers. This API allows programs and websites to access (parts of) the
  VNDB database without actually visiting the website.
 <br /><br />
 In addition to this real-time API, we also provide some information in the
 form of <a href="/d14">database dumps</a>.
 <br /><br />
</p>

<b>Design goals</b>
<ul>
 <li>
  Simple in implementation of both client and server. "Simple" here means that
  it shouldn't take much code to write a secure and full implementation and that
  client applications shouldn't require huge dependency trees just to use this API.
 </li>
 <li>Powerful: Not as powerful as raw SQL, but not as rigid as commonly used REST or RPC protocols.</li>
 <li>High-level: common applications need to perform only few actions to get what they want.</li>
 <li>Fast: minimal bandwidth overhead and simple and customizable queries.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<b>Design overview</b>
<ul>
 <li>TCP-based, all communication between the client and the server is done
  using one TCP connection. This connection stays alive until it is explicitely
  closed by either the client or the server.</li>
 <li>Request/response, client sends a request and server replies with a response.</li>
 <li>Session-based: clients are required to login before issuing commands to
  the server. A session is created by issuing the 'login' command, this session
  stays valid for the lifetime of the TCP connection.</li>
 <li><b>Everything</b> sent between the client and the server is encoded in UTF-8.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<b>Limits</b>
<p>The following limits are enforced by the server, in order to limit the
server resources and prevent abuse of this service.</p>
<ul>
 <li>5 connections per IP. All connections that are opened after reaching this limit will be immediately closed.</li>
 <li>100 commands per 10 minutes per ip. Server will reply with a 'throttled' error (type="cmd") when reaching this limit.</li>
 <li>
  1 second of SQL time per minute per ip. SQL time is the total time taken to
  run the database queries for each command.  This depends on both the command
  (filters and get flags) and server load, and is thus not very predictable.
  Server will reply with a 'throttled' error with type="sql" upon reaching
  this limit.
 </li>
 <li>Each command returns at most 25 results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
 These limits may sound strict, but in practice you won't have to worry much
 about it. As long as your application properly waits when the server replies
 with a "throttle" error, everything will be handled automatically. In the event
 that your application does require more resources, don't hesitate to ask.
</p>


<br />
<b>Connection info:</b>
<dl>
 <dt>Host</dt><dd>api.vndb.org (primary), beta.vndb.org (available for testing)</dd>
 <dt>Port (tcp)</dt><dd>19534 ('VN')</dd>
</dl>

<br />
<b>Disclaimer</b>
<p>These notes should be obvious, but I'll point it out anyway.</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  This service is still experimental and is provided for free. No guarantees
  are given about the stability and uptime of this service. It may disappear
  at any time, and access to it can be restricted without prior notice.
 </li>
 <li>
  Changes to this API can be made without prior notice. Backwards compatibility
  is provided when feasable, but non-compatible changes may be made at some
  point.  It is the responsibility of the application developers to keep their
  applications up-to-date.
 </li>
 <li>
  This service does not grant anyone the right to copy or republish the
  information fetched using the API. VNDB does not have a clear copyright
  statement, and in general we're not very strict about other people copying
  our information, but this API is not intended to be used for fetching and
  publishing more than half of our database. When in doubt, ask.
 </li>
 <li>
  Lastly, this API is not complete. If you have any specific features you'd
  like to see, don't hesitate to ask.
 </li>
</ul>

<br />
<b>Implementation tips</b>
<p>Like the disclaimer, these notes should be obvious, but it can't hurt to state them anyway.</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Cache as much as you can, the data on VNDB doesn't change very often. Even if
  you only refresh the cached information once every month, you can be sure
  that most of the data hasn't changed within that time.
 </li>
 <li>
  Program defensively. Even when the documentation says that a string will be
  returned, it may very well happen that this is later changed into an array.
  Make sure your application doesn't completely crash in such an event. Also keep
  in mind that for every command you send, the server can reply with an error, or
  can immediately close the connection (but this should be rare).
 </li>
 <li>
  Regularly check this page to see if anything has changed to the API, and
  update your client when necessary. A change log can be found on the bottom of
  this page. It is recommended to subscribe to the <a
  href="/feeds/announcements.atom">announcements Atom feed</a>.
 </li>
 <li>
  Use a JSON library for both encoding and decoding JSON data. While the format
  is relatively easy to use, you're much more likely to introduce bugs when you're
  writing your own parser.
 </li>
</ul>



:SUB:Request/response syntax
<p>
 The VNDB API uses the JSON format for data in various places, this document assumes
 you are familiar with it. See <a href="http://json.org/">JSON.org</a> for a quick
 overview and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt?number=4627">RFC 4627</a>
 for the glory details.
 <br /><br />
 The words <i>object</i>, <i>array</i>, <i>value</i>, <i>string</i>,
 <i>number</i> and <i>integer</i> refer to the JSON data types. In addition the following
 definitions are used in this document:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt><i>request</i> or <i>command</i></dt><dd>
  Message sent from the client to the server.
 </dd><dt><i>response</i></dt><dd>
  Message sent from the server to the client.
 </dd><dt><i>whitespace</i></dt><dd>
  Any sequence of the following characters: space, tab, line feed and carriage
  return.  (hexadecimal: 20, 09, 0A, 0D, respectively). This is in line with the
  definition of whitespace in the JSON specification.
 </dd><dt><i>date</i></dt><dd>
  A <i>string</i> signifying a date (in particular: release date). The
  following formats are used: "yyyy" (when day and month are unknown), "yyyy-mm"
  (when day is unknown) "yyyy-mm-dd", and "tba" (To Be Announced). If the year is
  not known and the date is not "tba", the special value <b>null</b> is used.
 </dd>
</dl>
<br />

<b>Message format</b>
<p>
 A message is formatted as a command or response name, followed by any number of
 arguments, followed by the End Of Transmission character (04 in hexadecimal).
 Arguments are separated by one or more whitespace characters, and any sequence
 of whitespace characters is allowed before and after the message.<br />
 The command or response name is an unescaped string containing only lowercase
 alphabetical ASCII characters, and indicates what kind of command or response
 this message contains.<br />
 An argument can either be an unescaped string (not containing whitespace), any
 JSON value, or a filter string. The following two examples demonstrate a
 'login' command, with an object as argument. Both messages are equivalent, as
 the whitespace is ignored. '0x04' is used to indicate the End Of Transmission
 character.
</p>
<pre>
 login {"protocol":1,"username":"ayo"}<b class="standout">0x04</b>
</pre><pre>
 login {
  "protocol" : 1,
  "username" : "ayo"
 }
 <b class="standout">0x04</b>
</pre>
The 0x04 byte will be ommitted in the other examples in this document. It is
however still required.<br />

<br />
<b>Filter string syntax</b>
<p>
 Some commands accept a filter string as argument. This argument is formatted
 similar to boolean expressions in most programming languages. A filter consists
 of one or more <i>expressions</i>, separated by the boolean operators "and" or
 "or" (lowercase). Each filter expression can be surrounded by parentheses to
 indicate precedence, the filter argument itself must be surrounded by parentheses.
 <br />
 An <i>expression</i> consists of a <i>field name</i>, followed by an
 <i>operator</i> and a <i>value</i>. The field name must consist entirely of
 lowercase alphanumeric characters and can also contain an underscore. The
 operator must be one of the following characters: =, !=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;,
 &gt;= or ~.  The <i>value</i> can be any valid JSON value. Whitespace
 characters are allowed, but not required, between all expressions, field names,
 operators and values.<br />
 The following two filters are equivalent:
</p>
<pre>
 (title~"osananajimi"or(id=2))
</pre><pre>
 (
   id = 2
   or
   title ~ "osananajimi"
 )
</pre>
<p>More complex filters are also possible:</p>
<pre>
 ((platforms = ["win", "ps2"] or languages = "ja") and released > "2009-01-10")
</pre>
<p>See the individual commands for more details.</p>


:SUB:The 'login' command
<pre>
 login {"protocol":1,"client":"test","clientver":0.1,"username":"ayo","password":"hi-mi-tsu!"}
</pre>
<p>
 Every client is required to login before issuing other commands. The login
 command accepts a JSON object as argument. This object has the following members:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>protocol</dt><dd>An integer that indicates which protocol version the client implements. Must be 1.</dd>
 <dt>client</dt><dd>
  A string identifying the client application. Between the 3 and 50 characters,
  must contain only alphanumeric ASCII characters, space, underscore and hyphens.
  When writing a client, think of a funny (unique) name and hardcode it into
  your application.
 </dd><dt>clientver</dt><dd>A number or string indicating the software version of the client.</dd>
 <dt>username</dt><dd>(optional) String containing the username of the person using the client.</dd>
 <dt>password</dt><dd>(optional) String, password of that user in plain text.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
 The server replies with either 'ok' (no arguments), or 'error' (see below).
 Note that logging in using a username or password is optional, but some
 commands are only available when logged in.
</p>


:SUB:The 'dbstats' command
<p>
 This command gives the global database statistics that are visible in the main
 menu of the site. The command is simply:
</p>
<pre>
 dbstats
</pre>
<p>And the response has the following format:</p>
<pre>
 dbstats <b class="standout">stats</b>
</pre>
<p>Where <i>stats</i> is a JSON object with integer values. Example response:</p>
<pre>
 dbstats {"users":49084,
          "threads":3998,
          "tags":1627,
          "releases":28071,
          "producers":3456,
          "chars":14046,
          "posts":52470,
          "vn":13051,
          "traits":1272}
</pre>


:SUB:The 'get' command
<p>
 This command is used to fetch data from the database. It accepts 4 arguments:
 the type of data to fetch (e.g. visual novels or producers), what part of that
 data to fetch (e.g. only the VN titles, or the descriptions and relations as
 well), a filter expression, and lastly some options.
</p>
<pre>
 get <b class="standout">type flags filters options</b>
</pre>
<p>
 <i>type</i> and <i>flags</i> are unescaped strings. The accepted values for <i>type</i> are
 documented below.  <i>flags</i> is a comma-separated list of flags indicating what
 info to fetch. The filters, available flags and their meaning are documented
 separately for each type. The last <i>options</i> argument is optional, and
 influences the behaviour of the returned results. When present, <i>options</i>
 should be a JSON object with the following members (all are optional):
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>page</dt><dd>
  integer, used for pagination. Page 1 (the default) returns the first 10
  results (1-10), page 2 returns the following 10 (11-20), etc. (The actual
  number of results per page can be set with the "results" option below).
 </dd><dt>results</dt><dd>
  integer, maximum number of results to return. Also affects the "page" option
  above. For example: with "page" set to 2 and "results" set to 5, the second
  five results (that is, results 6-10) will be returned. Default: 10.
 </dd><dt>sort</dt><dd>
  string, the field to order the results by. The accepted field names differ
  per type, the default sort field is the ID of the database entry.
 </dd>
 <dt>reverse</dt><dd>boolean, default false. Set to true to reverse the order of the results.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
 The following example will fetch basic information and information about the
 related anime of the visual novel with id = 17:
</p>
<pre>
 get vn basic,anime (id = 17)
</pre>
<p>
 The server will reply with a 'results' message, this message is followed by a
 JSON object describing the results. This object has three members: 'num', which
 is an integer indicating the number of results returned, 'more', which is true
 when there are more results available (i.e. increasing the <i>page</i> option
 described above will give new results) and 'items', which contains the results
 as an array of objects. For example, the server could reply to the previous
 command with the following message:
</p>
<pre>
 results {"num":1, "more":false, "items":[{
   "id": 17, "title": "Ever17 -the out of infinity-", "original": null,
   "released": "2002-08-29", "languages": ["en","ja","ru","zh"],
   "platforms": ["drc","ps2","psp","win"],"anime": []
 }]}
</pre>
<p>
 Note that the actual result from the server can (and likely will) be formatted
 differently and that the order of the members may not be the same. What each
 member means and what possible values they can have differs per type and is
 documented below.

:SUB:The 'set' command
<p>
 The set command can be used to modify stuff in the database. It can only be
 used when logged in as a user. The command has the following syntax:
</p>
<pre>
 set <b class="standout">type id fields</b>
</pre>
<p>
 Here, <i>type</i> is similar to the type argument to the 'get' command,
 <i>id</i> is the (integer) identifier of the database entry to change, and
 <i>fields</i> is an object with the fields to set or modify. If the
 <i>fields</i> object is not present, the set command works as a 'delete'. The
 interpretation of the <i>id</i> and <i>fields</i> arguments depend on the
 <i>type</i>, and are documented in the sections below.<br />
 <br />
 But before that, let me present some examples to get a feel on what the
 previous paragraph meant. The following example adds a '10' vote on <a
 href="/v17">v17</a>, or changes the vote to a 10 if a previous vote was
 already present:
</p>
<pre>
 set votelist 17 {"vote":100}
</pre>
<p>And here's how to remove the previous vote:</p>
<pre>
 set votelist 17
</pre>
<p>
 'set' replies with a simple 'ok' on success, or with an 'error' (see below) on
 failure. Note that, due to my laziness, no error is currently returned if the
 identifier does not exist. So voting on a VN that does not exist will return
 an 'ok', but no vote is actually added. This behaviour may change in the
 future. Note that this API doesn't care whether the VN has been deleted or
 not, so you can manage votes and stuff for deleted VNs (Which isn't very
 helpful, because 'get vn' won't return a thing for deleted VNs).
</p>

:SUBSUB:set votelist
<p>
 This command facilitates adding, removing and modifying votes. The
 <i>identifier</i> argument is the visual novel ID, and the following fields
 are recognized:
</p>
<table style="margin: 5px 2%; width: 95%">
 <thead><tr>
  <td style="width: 80px">Field</td>
  <td style="width: 90px">Type</td>
  <td>Description</td>
 </tr></thead>
 <tr class="odd">
  <td>vote</td>
  <td>integer</td>
  <td>Same as the 'vote' member returned by 'get votelist', in the range 10 to 100. This field has no default; it must always be present.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
 The 'added' member returned by 'get votelist' is, as its name implies, only
 set when the vote is added. Changing an existing vote will not update the
 'added' field.
</p>

:SUBSUB:set vnlist
<p>
 This command facilitates adding, removing and modifying your VN list. The
 <i>identifier</i> argument is the visual novel ID, and the following fields
 are recognized:
</p>
<table style="margin: 5px 2%; width: 95%">
 <thead><tr>
  <td style="width: 80px">Field</td>
  <td style="width: 90px">Type</td>
  <td>Description</td>
 </tr></thead>
 <tr class="odd">
  <td>status</td>
  <td>integer</td>
  <td>Same as the 'status' member returned by 'get vnlist'. Default: 0</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>notes</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Same as the 'notes' member returned by 'get vnlist'. An empty string is considered equivalent to 'null'. A newline is currently not allowed because the web interface won't handle them well. Default: null.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
 Sames notes about the 'added' member for 'set votelist' applies here.<br />
 Also note that, when removing a vnlist item, any releases associated with the
 VN will be removed from the users' list as well. The release list
 functionality is not currently exposed to the API, so this will only be
 visible when the web interface is used.
</p>

:SUBSUB:set wishlist
<p>
 This command facilitates adding, removing and modifying VNs from your
 wishlist. The <i>identifier</i> argument is the visual novel ID, and the
 following fields are recognized:
</p>
<table style="margin: 5px 2%; width: 95%">
 <thead><tr>
  <td style="width: 80px">Field</td>
  <td style="width: 90px">Type</td>
  <td>Description</td>
 </tr></thead>
 <tr class="odd">
  <td>priority</td>
  <td>integer</td>
  <td>Same as the 'priority' member returned by 'get wishlist'.</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<p>
 Sames notes about the 'added' member for 'set votelist' applies here.<br />
</p>



:SUB:The 'error' response
<p>
 Every command to the server can receive an 'error' response, this response has one
 argument: a JSON object containing at least a member named "id", which identifies
 the error, and a "msg", which contains a human readable message explaining what
 went wrong. Other members are also possible, depending on the value of "id".
 Example error message:
</p>
<pre>
 error {"id":"parse", "msg":"Invalid command or argument"}
</pre>
<p>
 Note that the value of "msg" is not directly linked to the error identifier:
 the message explains what went wrong in more detail, there are several
 different messages for the same id. The following error identifiers are currently
 defined:
</p>
<dl>
 <dt>parse</dt><dd>Syntax error, unknown command or invalid argument type.</dd>
 <dt>missing</dt><dd>A JSON object argument is missing a required member. The name of which is given in the additional "field" member.</dd>
 <dt>badarg</dt><dd>A JSON value is of the wrong type or in the wrong format. The name of the incorrect field is given in a "field" member.</dd>
 <dt>needlogin</dt><dd>Need to be logged in to issue this command.</dd>
 <dt>throttled</dt><dd>
  You have used too many server resources within a short time, and need to wait
  a bit before sending the next command.  The type of throttle is given in the
  "type" member, and the "minwait" and "fullwait" members tell you how long you
  need to wait before sending the next command and when you can start bursting
  again (this is the recommended waiting time), respectively.  Both values are in
  seconds, with one decimal after the point.
 </dd>
 <dt>auth</dt><dd>(login) Incorrect username/password combination.</dd>
 <dt>loggedin</dt><dd>(login) Already logged in. Only one successful login command can be issues on one connection.</dd>
 <dt>gettype</dt><dd>(get) Unknown type argument to the 'get' command.</dd>
 <dt>getinfo</dt><dd>(get) Unknown info flag to the 'get' command. The name of the unrecognised flag is given in an additional "flag" member.</dd>
 <dt>filter</dt><dd>(get) Unknown filter field or invalid combination of field/operator/argument type. Includes three additional members: "field", "op" and "value" of the incorrect expression.</dd>
 <dt>settype</dt><dd>(set) Unknown type argument to the 'set' command.</dd>
</dl>
